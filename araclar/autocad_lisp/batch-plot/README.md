## Why BPDF?

AutoCAD's built-in Batch Plot works at the Layout level.
BPDF works in **Model Space** — common workflow in Taiwan and Asia where all drawings are arranged in one Model Space with individual title block frames.

Similar tools exist in Chinese-language communities (e.g. 秋楓 BatchPlot) but are closed-source and Chinese only. BPDF is open source and works globally.

## About

Made by an AutoCAD user in Taiwan who got tired of plotting sheets one by one.
